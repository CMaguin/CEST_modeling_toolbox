# Toy data set - Glutamate phantoms (09.03.2024)

CEST data acquired in 100 mM glutamate phantoms at pH 7.01 in different buffers (H2O MilliQ / HEPES 10 mM / PBS 10 mM) and at different temperatures (22°C room temperature / 36,6°C with heating pad).

## Experimental parameters  
B0 = 11.7 T  
Continuous-wave saturation  
tsat = 1 s  
B1 = [1:1:10] µT  
LASER-CEST sequence used for acquisition (see Maguin et al., 2024 MRM)  
TR = 5s, TE = 25 ms, 40 µL voxel  
1 average for each offset after 1 dummy scan  
Normalization by M0 acquired at -20 ppm  
Offsets detailed in freq_ppm file  


## T1/T2 study :   
T1 was roughly estimated via inversion-recovery LASER measurements and mono-exponential fitting.  
T2 was roughly estimated via multiple echo-times LASER measurements and mono-exponential fitting.
